        <p>There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it,
            which facilitates one's thought processes. A common view is that the epithet "art", particular in its 
            elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration 
            of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill 
            of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, 
            art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.[56] Rembrandt's work, now praised 
            for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.[57] At the turn of the 20th century,
            the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual 
            fluency,[58] yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast,
            Pablo Picasso,was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of 
            expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.</p>

<h2>Forms, genres, media, and styles</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
    <img src="~/images/800px-Ingres,_Napoleon_on_his_Imperial_throne.jpg" width="200" align="right" />  The creative arts are often
    divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles,
    and form.[47] Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the
    methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae)
    ,[48] such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include visual design
    principles,such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm.


    In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content,
    and context.[49] Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form)
    . Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials,
    techniques, and form.[50] Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors
    refer to subject matter and content – i.e.,
    denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like meaning and significance.

    Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the
    content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.[51]
    It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,[52] and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.
    For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia.
