    From 16–20 November 2018, the Culture College of Art presents Hidden, an exhibition showcasing work from
    over 50 of the College’s technical and non-academic staff. From jewellery and textile design, sculpture 
    and performance to floristry and interactive photographic work, this exhibition brings to the fore talent 
    and technical skills that are often hidden from those outside the College.

    The CCA’s technical staff have a wealth of skills-based knowledge which is put to use on a daily basis 
    supporting students across the College. As part of the learning environment, the RCA provides specialist
    facilities encompassing traditional workshops and cutting-edge digital technologies such as rapid prototyping, 
    CNC milling and laser-scanning. Technicians play a vital role at the College, supporting students in mastering
    the required skills for their particular aesthetic and approach. As Hidden highlights, many of these technicians
    are highly skilled specialists in both traditional crafts as well as expert innovators with newer technologies.

    Finnish textile designer and Technical Instructor in Printed Textiles, Jonna Saarinen, has created a new hand
    screen-printed collection of large-scale wall hangings and furniture pieces designed for the exhibition. 
    The collection draws inspiration from the light summer nights on the Finnish archipelago and swimming in
    the gentle waves of the Baltic Sea in the moonlight. The pieces have been designed with hand-cut stencils 
    and screenprinted on to linen and wood using soil association-approved eco-inks.

    Annie Hendric – designer, researcher and 3D Making Technician at the CCA – is showing some material samples 
    from her practice investigating transitions through material language and digital technologies. These experiments
    invite a playful dialogue between human and material and are part of an ongoing exploration of the relationship
    between hard and soft surfaces. Technical Instructor in 3D Making Kevin Koekkoek is exhibiting his 3D Printed clock
    and art deco-inspired 3D printed lampshade. Made from Nylon SLS they are durable, have a unique texture and can be 
    made to order through 3D printing platforms, removing the need for Kevin to be involved in the fabrication and shipping 
    process.

    Studio Bergini, a graphic design studio founded by Kristian Hjorth Berge and Francesco Corsini, run the Royal
    Duplication Centre within the School of Communication at the CCA. The pair have produced an impressive portfolio
    of design work from highly conceptual artist publications to large-scale festival identities. At Hidden they will
    showcase Annual Report MMXVI–MMXVII, a unique and abstract glimpse into the leftover prints produced by students
    at the CCA.
