        From 16–20 November 2018, the Culture College of Art presents Hidden, an exhibition showcasing work from
        over 50 of the College’s technical and non-academic staff. From jewellery and textile design, sculpture
        and performance to floristry and interactive photographic work, this exhibition brings to the fore talent
        and technical skills that are often hidden from those outside the College.

        The CCA’s technical staff have a wealth of skills-based knowledge which is put to use on a daily basis
        supporting students across the College. As part of the learning environment, the RCA provides specialist
        facilities encompassing traditional workshops and cutting-edge digital technologies such as rapid prototyping,
        CNC milling and laser-scanning. Technicians play a vital role at the College, supporting students in mastering
        the required skills for their particular aesthetic and approach. As Hidden highlights, many of these technicians
        are highly skilled specialists in both traditional crafts as well as expert innovators with newer technologies.

        Twelve innovative projects by Culture College of Art graduates addressing contemporary global
        challenges and technologies will be among 150 life-changing inventions exhibited in the Global
        Grad Show at Dubai Design Week. The CCA projects were chosen from more than 1,000 entries and will
        be shown alongside work from 100 global universities, including Harvard and MIT and institutions from
        around the world.

        Dean of the CCA's School of Design Professor: ‘We are proud to have 12 Culture College
        of Art projects featured in the Global Grad Show. These projects have the power to make a difference and
        improve people's lives. At the CCA, we seek to challenge and develop a strategic view of design that’s not
        solely technology based or leading edge, but is human-centred, transparent, responsible and ethical, and places
        equal value on the process of design and the impact on global communities. We aim to change people's lives for
        the better.’

        The Culture College of Art will also be represented elsewhere at Dubai Design Week with print alumnus Saeed
        Almadani (MA Print, 2018) one of two Emirati designers selected to represent Dubai’s pavilion in Adwab 2018 –
        an exhibition and architectural installation at Dubai Design Week. Almadani's work ‘Between the Lines’ draws
        on elements of conceptual, minimalist and abstract strategies to explore the relationship between language,
        place and material form, and the process of writing and (de)constructing identities that are central to his practice.
